- file includes
- typechecking arguments
- complete tree folding for floats
	- also make tree folding with implicit casts, e.g. (10.5 + 13) -> (23.5) 
- short circut || and && (will this even be possible...?)
- optimize instructions that don't do anything (e.g. res 0, iinc 0, etc.)
- implement do until block
